# Infinite Monkeys
Essentially just some code for the (infinite monkey theorem)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite_monkey_theorem]
Nothing really over the top,
just 8 'Monkeys' running parallel to each other typing random capital letters, spaces, or new lines.

## Running:
When running (either via the jar or class files) the first argument passed to the program 
**must** be a number as this is the delay between the monkeys' 'keypresses'.
ie:
`java -jar infiniteMonkeys-0.1.jar (number)`
or
`java code.eris.infiniteMonkeys.Main (number)`
